# In the future, it makes sense to generate the county & state
# config from a pre-config script that takes in user input
# for which counties or areas they want to study. Then, 
# the config.yaml is generated from this user input
# in the following structure so that snakemake can do its
# magic. We would want to distribute jobs by 
# nation, state, county so they could run in parallel

# Below are urls and api endpoints
# for obtaining all raw data
# We will organize by county, state
# and national downloads
# And then, within each, we will
# organize by url and api calls
# Finally, we will include key/val pairs
# for component type (i.e. haz, exp, vuln)
# and other identifiers (i.e. social, physical)
# that are useful for organizational logic

# There are different rules for downloading
# data from API or URL endpoints, since the former
# require some parameters whereas the latter
# point straight to a file to download
# We will first have keys
# for api/url 
# Then we will structure by keys
# for the data type (i.e. haz/exp)
# that will define file directories and paths
# These all need to be nested within 
# the following keys
# county, state, national, external
# we want to download data from
# largest to smallest scale (i.e. national, state, county)
# because of their set-type relationships (i.e. many counties in one state
# and many states in one nation)
# Some data downloads are not scale based, so
# downloaded once and from the "external" key
# (this is theoretical, not relevant to our case study)

# Constants for loss estimation
# Uncertainty for structure values
# State of the art automated valuation models
# are generally mean unbiased
# This paper https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09599916.2020.1807587
# suggests that a linear model can capture ~ 40% of structure value
# estimates by w/in 10% of their value, and ~ 83% of structure value estimates
# by w/in 30% of their value
# We don't have guidance on what
# the accuracy of NJ assessments are
# We also don't have guidance on how well the
# NSI structure values are calibrated. They are modeled from
# a non-transparent process and do not come with uncertainty
# or bias estimates
# If we use guidance from the Krause et al. paper linked
# above, we can define a normal distribution that is centered
# at the predicted value and has a standard deviation
# equal to predicted value * .3. If you 
# look at the probability of getting a value > 
# the predicted value + predicted value *.3, it's
# around .158, and same for the other side. So
# we can push our scaling factor down a bit
# to try and get the probability 
# of being above or under 
# predicted value + predicted value *.3
# to around .1 on either side. That would be
# consistent with the finding in Krause
# This leads to a scaling factor of about .25
# Another interpretation for this scaling factor
# is the coefficient of variation around
# the mean
